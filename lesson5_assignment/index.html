<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
<p><em>This page will provide information for the exploration of the ethnic, demographic and culture patterns of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.</em> The objective 
is to identify the demographic, ethnic and historical patterns that contribute to the current socio-political and cultural makeup of western Pennsylvania. This is a 
critical area because it served as the original crossroads of America. All immigrants moving west traversed these lands to reach the Ohio River which took them on to 
Ohio, Kentucky Missouri and the western territories. Most of the people examined in this study violated the law by moving west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Royal 
Proclamation of 1763 forbade all residents of any English colony from travelling west of the mountains in order to limit the expense of protecting them. The British 
king’s budget was stretched thin after the French and Indian War. Thus the character of the people who inhabited this area was uniquely brazen relative to the other 
colonialists</p>


<p>The basis for this analysis is Colin Woodward’s recent work, American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures in North America. Woodward identified 
eleven distinct major culture groups that constitute the population of the United States in 2012. He maintains that these groups are spread all over the nation today but 
not proportionately. Some areas have one or two groups that predominate but there are usually members of each group in every area. Woodward maintains that examining any area can identify the cultural 
delineation of that geographic space today. </p>


<p>These eleven groups are based on cultural roots that may or may not have a basis in ethnicity, religion, economics or other traditional factors. </p>

<p>One can take the population of any area and trace it back ten generation to see what the basis for that particular region is. 
That is what will be accomplished with this examination relative to the key region of Western Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Westmoreland County was founded on February 26, 1773 and was the first county
in the colony of Pennsylvania west of the Allegheny Mountains. Westmoreland 
County originally included all of Western Pennsylvania. It encompassed the 
present-day counties of Fayette, Washington, Greene, Beaver, Allegheny, Indiana
and Armstrong counties. The current day county seat is Greensburg. The original 
county seat was Hannah’s Town. This territory was originally purchased by the 
descendants of William Penn in order to block out Virginia’s expansion to the 
west of William Penn’ s original colony. Penn arrived late to America and was 
challenged on all sides by earlier settlements. Pennsylvania fought two wars 
with Maryland resulting in the Mason Dixon Line. It faced the <strong>Dutch and 
Scots</strong> to the east and the <strong>Swedish</strong> encroachment to the
south. <strong>Virginia</strong>, the most powerful adversary had already 
annexed the territory of Westmoreland into Augusta County and sent 
<strong>George Washington</strong> out to protect it. </p>
